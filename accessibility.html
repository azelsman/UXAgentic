        <p><em>Last updated: September 1, 2025</em></p>

        <p>
            Elevated Narratives LLC (“<strong>Elevated Narratives</strong>,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to making our
            website, quizzes, and services accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>
            We strive to follow the <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA</strong>, which define
            how to make web content more usable for people with a wide range of abilities.
        </p>

        <h2>2. What We’ve Done</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed our quiz and reports with semantic HTML and ARIA labels where appropriate.</li>
            <li>Ensured navigation is possible via keyboard and screen readers.</li>
            <li>Used accessible contrast ratios and scalable text for readability.</li>
            <li>Provided clear instructions and error messages within forms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Ongoing Efforts</h2>
        <p>
            Accessibility is an ongoing effort. We regularly review our site and services, test with assistive technologies,
            and improve based on user feedback.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Tools</h2>
        <p>
            Some third-party integrations (such as payment processors or video hosting platforms) may not fully meet the same
            accessibility standards. While we do not control these providers, we encourage them to improve and will assist
            users where possible.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Feedback</h2>
        <p>
            If you encounter accessibility barriers on our site or services, please let us know so we can address them:

        <h2>6. Enforcement</h2>
        <p>

            quickly and directly.
